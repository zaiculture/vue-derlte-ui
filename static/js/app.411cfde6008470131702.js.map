classes to apply to the generated popper.\n * @param {Array} [popper.attributes] Array of attributes to apply, specify `attr:value` to assign a value to it.\n * @param {HTMLElement|String} [popper.parent=window.document.body] The parent element, given as HTMLElement or as query string.\n * @param {String} [popper.content=''] The content of the popper, it can be text, html, or node; if it is not text, set `contentType` to `html` or `node`.\n * @param {String} [popper.contentType='text'] If `html`, the `content` will be parsed as HTML.

It must be child of\n *      its parent Popper. Popper.js will apply to the given element the style required to align the arrow with its\n *      reference element.\n *      By default, it will look for a child node of the popper with the `x-arrow` attribute.\n *\n * @param {Boolean} [options.gpuAcceleration=true]\n *      When this property is set to true, the popper position will be applied using CSS3 translate3d, allowing the\n *      browser to use the GPU to accelerate the rendering.\n *      If set to false, the popper will be placed using `top` and `left` properties, not using the GPU.\n *\n * @param {Number} [options.offset=0]\n *      Amount of pixels the popper will be shifted (can be negative).\n *\n * @param {String|Element} [options.boundariesElement='viewport']\n *      The element which will define the boundaries of the popper position, the popper will never be placed outside\n *      of the defined boundaries (except if `keepTogether` is enabled)\n *\n * @param {Number} [options.boundariesPadding=5]\n *      Additional padding for the boundaries\n *\n * @param {Array} [options.preventOverflowOrder=['left', 'right', 'top', 'bottom']]\n *      Order used when Popper.js tries to avoid overflows from the boundaries, they will be checked in order,\n *      this means that the last ones will never overflow\n *\n * @param {String|Array} [options.flipBehavior='flip']\n *      The behavior used by the `flip` modifier to change the placement of the popper when the latter is trying to\n *      overlap its reference element. Defining `flip` as value, the placement will be flipped on\n *      its axis (`right - left`, `top - bottom`).\n *      You can even pass an array of placements (eg: `['right', 'left', 'top']` ) to manually specify\n *      how alter the placement when a flip is needed. (eg. in the above example, it would first flip from right to left,\n *      then, if even in its new placement, the popper is overlapping its reference element, it will be moved to top)\n *\n * @param {Array} [options.modifiers=[ 'shift', 'offset', 'preventOverflow', 'keepTogether', 'arrow', 'flip', 'applyStyle']]\n *      List of functions used to modify the data before they are applied to the popper, add your custom functions\n *      to this array to edit the offsets and placement.\n *      The function should reflect the @params and @returns of preventOverflow\n *\n * @param {Array} [options.modifiersIgnored=[]]\n *      Put here any built-in modifier name you want to exclude from the modifiers list\n *      The function should reflect the @params and @returns of preventOverflow\n *\n * @param {Boolean} [options.removeOnDestroy=false]\n *      Set to true if you want to automatically remove the popper when you call the `destroy` method.\n */\nfunction Popper (reference, popper, options) {\n    this._reference = reference.jquery ?
