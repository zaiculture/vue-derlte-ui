classes to apply to the generated popper.\n * @param {Array} [popper.attributes] Array of attributes to apply, specify `attr:value` to assign a value to it.\n * @param {HTMLElement|String} [popper.parent=window.document.body] The parent element, given as HTMLElement or as query string.\n * @param {String} [popper.content=''] The content of the popper, it can be text, html, or node; if it is not text, set `contentType` to `html` or `node`.\n * @param {String} [popper.contentType='text'] If `html`, the `content` will be parsed as HTML.

Defining `flip` as value, the placement will be flipped on\n *      its axis (`right - left`, `top - bottom`).\n *      You can even pass an array of placements (eg: `['right', 'left', 'top']` ) to manually specify\n *      how alter the placement when a flip is needed. (eg. in the above example, it would first flip from right to left,\n *      then, if even in its new placement, the popper is overlapping its reference element, it will be moved to top)\n *\n * @param {Array} [options.modifiers=[ 'shift', 'offset', 'preventOverflow', 'keepTogether', 'arrow', 'flip', 'applyStyle']]\n *      List of functions used to modify the data before they are applied to the popper, add your custom functions\n *      to this array to edit the offsets and placement.\n *      The function should reflect the @params and @returns of preventOverflow\n *\n * @param {Array} [options.modifiersIgnored=[]]\n *      Put here any built-in modifier name you want to exclude from the modifiers list\n *      The function should reflect the @params and @returns of preventOverflow\n *\n * @param {Boolean} [options.removeOnDestroy=false]\n *      Set to true if you want to automatically remove the popper when you call the `destroy` method.\n */\nfunction Popper (reference, popper, options) {\n    this._reference = reference.jquery ?
